On this page you will find some 3rd party material that is related to
openMSX, but not written by the openMSX authors. This also means that
the openMSX authors do not support it, nor keep it up to date, as it is
unofficial. But it can be very interesting for our users and we also
like it very much that people write applications around openMSX or write
extra documentation. Keep up the good work, people!

Oh, and if there's some interesting stuff we missed, please let us know!

# Launchers

## [openMSX Launcher](http://msxlaunchers.info/)

An openMSX version of the blueMSX Launcher, mostly targeted at
launching games. It supports screenshots for games and a large number
of languages. Multiplatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD.

## [NekoLauncher openMSX](http://nekocanmac.seesaa.net/)

Because the old style Catapult does not run (properly) on Mac,
an active Japanese emulator user/programmer wrote an openMSX
variant of his NekoLauncher series. It's not only getting more and
more advanced, but also seems to be very user friendly.

## [openMSX Peashooter](http://cesco.it/il-mio-software-gratuito/openmsx-peashooter/)

*unfortunately the site seems to have disappeared*

For the same reason, Cesco made another launcher for openMSX on OS X.
It seems to be focused mainly on games and features image previews.

# Documentation

## [openMSX Compilation Guide for OS X](http://www.msxgamesbox.com/passion/msxgamesbox/Sections/emumac/openmsx.php)

This article on The MSX Games Box (now part of Passion MSX) explains
the compilation process of openMSX on MacOS X in great detail, however,
it is now mostly outdated.

## [Hyper-easy openMSX for Mac OS X](http://www.passionmsx.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=26)

This article on Passion MSX explains to install a binary
version of openMSX and NekoLauncher openMSX on your Mac. It is probably
quite outdated, though, as it was written in 2006.

# Miscellaneous

## [openMSX Daily Builds](http://openmsx.fixato.net/)

FiXato created a great web site which provides you with daily built
binaries of openMSX. Very much recommended if you want to try out
development versions of openMSX without compiling them yourself!
Currently supporting Windows, Mac OS X, Android and OpenDingux platforms.

## [OpenMSX Control Plugin for Gedit](http://msx.jannone.org/openMSXcontrol/)

Rafael Jannone made an interesting thing: a plugin for Gedit, so that
you can easily test your MSX Basic programs in openMSX, while using
the Gedit text editor. He wrote a whole load of Python scripts to
make this possible. They might be nice to reuse for other apps!
