openMSX 0.9.0—Enigma—improves a lot on accuracy of floppy support, especially by the introduction of support for the DMK format. This means it should be possible to run all MSX disk software without patching it. Furthermore, our efforts to improve performance has some results: start up time has almost halved on a Dingoo A320! 


Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released.


Please read the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openmsx/files/openmsx/0.9.0/README_release-notes.txt/view) for details.
