+++


Today we moved all openMSX projects to Git (still on SourceForge.net), after having used Subversion for about 6 and a half years.
Git is now the state of the art on source code management and rapidly getting more popular. 


Anyway, this means that you have to use a different way to get the latest openMSX sources now: click on one of the repos to see the instructions at the top. 
The Subversion repository will be deleted soon. Also, we've converted the project on SF.net from classic to Allura. You'll notice that when visiting the project page, especially when you check the new Tickets system, e.g. the bug tracker.
