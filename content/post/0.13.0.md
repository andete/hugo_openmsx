openMSX 0.13.0—Black Cat—again was meant to be (mostly) a bug fix release, but again it also has some nice additions and improvements to enjoy. Important improvements are much better support for VDP I/O delay in turbo machines (fixing graphics issues due to too fast VDP access there), more accurate MSX1 color palette, progress reporting for long operations and ALSA MIDI-out support for Linux. This is also one of the first releases that drops support for older platforms: Windows XP, Dingoo A320 (but introducing support for GCW Zero) and non-64-bit MacOSX. If you still want to run openMSX on these, you'll be stuck on using a previous release or start maintaining these platforms yourself. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We again made a small amount of improvements: fixed Catapult interrupting replay directly after loading it, performance improvements while reversing, fixed drag-and-drop for media and some smaller bug fixes. Please read the [release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMSX/openMSX/RELEASE_0_13_0/doc/release-notes.txt) notes for details of the openMSX changes.
