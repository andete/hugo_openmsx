That is, if you've got some spare time and want to develop fun software for Windows. The openMSX team desperately needs Windows developers, both for coding on the openMSX code itself, and also for Catapult. Don't hesitate! Fire up you IRC client and visit us at #openmsx on Freenode.net. We won't bite. Really!
