openMSX 0.9.1—Enigma Take Two—mostly fixes a bug in dir-as-disk that was introduced in openMSX 0.9.0, when adding support for the DMK format and low level disk emulation. We not only fixed that bug, we rewrote dir-as-disk almost completely, making it a lot more robust. 


Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. Please read the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openmsx/files/openmsx/0.9.1/README_release-notes.txt/view) for details.
