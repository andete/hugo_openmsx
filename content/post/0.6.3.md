openMSX 0.6.3—Crystal Clear—includes advanced resampling for aliasing-free sound, a stereo balance setting for each sound chip, recording of separate channels, PSG detune and vibrato and some non-sound-related improvements as well. Also, a hang on Windows PCs with multi-core/HT CPUs is fixed. 


Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. 


Please read the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=38274&release_id=560483) for details.
