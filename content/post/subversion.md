Today we moved the main openMSX project to Subversion (SVN). This means that you have to use a different way to get the latest openMSX sources now. It is explained in the updated online manual, in the [Compilation Guide](http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/compile.html). Snapshots are now also taken from SVN. We removed the snapshot of Catapult, because Catapult as has been released so far is pronounced dead. A rewrite using Python and Qt4 is in the works though. You can get a snapshot of that project, instead.


Other news that we forgot to post here: there is a universal binary available for Mac OS X users, see the download section.
