openMSX 0.11.0—NotOneButDoubleOne—brings you the following important new features: 

 * VDP access timing now also for MSX1 modes (corruption with too fast VRAM access will be visible now)
 * implementation of most defailed differences between all used VDP chips and emulation of MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD

On top of that, there are some important (long standing) bug fixes, like the proper implementation of envelopes for MSX-AUDIO, fixing for example "Copy is Crime" by Impact. And last but not least, a lot of work was done under the bonnet, giving you even better performance and preparations for the future. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We only made some minor improvements to it this time. Please read the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openmsx/files/openmsx/0.11.0/README_release-notes.txt/view) for details of the openMSX changes.
