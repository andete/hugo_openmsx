openMSX 0.6.1—Chernoton Meltdown—includes runtime switchable machines and extensions, a lot of new video filters (some of which use pixel shaders), as well as a lot of other improvements and bugfixes.


Together with openMSX a new version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released.


Please read the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=435794&group_id=38274) for details.
