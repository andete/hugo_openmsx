[TASing](http://tasvideos.org/WelcomeToTASVideos.html)—Tool-Assisted-Speedrun—is the hobby of creating run-throughs of video games that resemble superhuman-like playing sessions.


Its main community web site is [tasvideos.org](http://tasvideos.org/) and it has a [limited list of approved emulators](http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources.html) which can be used to create a new TAS and is accepted for [submission](http://tasvideos.org/Subs-List.html). 


Today, the site [announced](http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=249886#249886) that openMSX is now officially approved to submit TASes! 


The [first MSX TAS](http://tasvideos.org/2884S.html) has already been submitted by our team member Vampier, which is of course no surprise. Neither is the game: Metal Gear. Who will improve his speedrun and submit a better TAS? The game is on!
